# yolov8

## Introduction
This repository has YOLOv8 Exercises (adapted from Ultralytics documentation). These exercises serve as supplementary tutorials for the ramp-up along the You Only Look Once (YOLO) learning curve. As you may have seen from the corresponding YouTube videos, the refinements in YOLO are continuous. This progress is accelerated by two key factors:
- Open Source dissemination of knowledge by Ultralytics
- Worldwide research interest in advancing YOLO

If you are interested in computer vision processing, you need to join the bandwagon on two fronts:
- OpenCV knowledge
- Ultralytics solutions

There will be a separate repository with fresh material on OpenCV. My previous attempts in publishing tutorials on OpenCV were feeble. Hopefully, in the coming months, the situation can be improved. But for now, here is an introductory journey on YOLOv8 while recognizing that YOLOv10 is now available! Time marches on.

## Basic Coverage
There are three sections in this repository:
- Basic
- Solutions
- Single Board Computers

## Basic
This section is intended to provide, as the name suggests, basic Python scripts to help you get started with YOLOv8. The demonstration programs are limited to images and videos. The demonstration for images will use all JPEG files in a folder. The demonstration for video is focused on demonstrating additional properties of the **results** object from object detection algorithms.

## Solutions
This section follows the footsteps of the Ultralytics documentation.

## Single Board Computers
This section demonstrates some of the basic solutions running on:
- Raspberry Pi
  - Model 5
  - Model 4 (planned)
- DFRobot UNIHIKER

# Acknowledgment
The basic codes in the repository were derived from Ultralytics documentation. The very minor modifications were to enable some _bells & whistles_ for users towards broader and general purpose use of the scripts.

The end-user scripts in this repository use YOLOv8 for its object detection features. For more details, refer to [Explore YOLOv8](https://yolov8.org/).
